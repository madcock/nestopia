nestopia-libretro
-----------------
Nestopia is a cycle accurate emulator for the NES/Famicom.

This is the libretro port of the Nestopia emulator, based on the de facto
upstream Nestopia JG fork, which lives at: https://gitlab.com/jgemu/nestopia

The libretro port contains an additional overclocking feature.

Famicom Disk System
-------------------
FDS support requires the FDS BIOS to be placed in the "system" directory:
 system/disksys.rom

ADPCM Samples
-------------
Some games have ADPCM audio samples on the cartridge, which are not included in
the ROM data. In order to use such samples with Nestopia, you must extract the
samples into the correct location under the System directory. They are
required to be in the "nestopia/samples" subdirectory named after the .zip file
in MAME format:
  moepro.zip        system/nestopia/samples/moepro/
  moepro88.zip      system/nestopia/samples/moepro88/
  mptennis.zip      system/nestopia/samples/mptennis/
  terao.zip         system/nestopia/samples/terao/
  ftaerobi.zip      system/nestopia/samples/ftaerobi/

The location of the System directory depends on the frontend and platform in
use. Refer to the frontend documentation.
